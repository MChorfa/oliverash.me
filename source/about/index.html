    <p>My name is Oliver, and I'm from a small town towards the south of England called Flitwick. Ever since I was about 13-years-old, I have lived and breathed the web.</p>
    <p>Now at 19-years-old, I reside in Leeds, England, where I'm studying in my third year at <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/">university</a> for a degree in New Media &ndash; but I prefer to be a bit more precise with that declaration; what I <em>actually</em> study is front-end web development. Currently, I'm on a full-time placement at <a href="http://clock.co.uk/" title="Go to the Clock homepage">Clock, a web shop based just outside of London</a>.</p>
    <p>On most occassions, you will find me sat contemplating in front of a DOM tree, figuring stuff out. I'm never happier than when I'm knees deep into a project, learning something new. I thoroughly enjoy the challenge of building scalable, flexible and maintainable websites &ndash; not just your ordinary local school website, but large and complicated websites. I have adopted principles the likes of <a href="http://oocss.org/">OOCSS</a> and <a href="http://smacss.com/" title="Go to SMACSS">SMACSS</a> for building my CSS, and I recently begun to use the <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> framework for building JavaScript webapps.</p>
    <p>I contribute code to <a href="https://github.com/OliverJAsh">GitHub</a>, wherever I can. I post snippets of my thoughts on <a href="http://twitter.com/oliverjash">Twitter</a>. Away from the computer, I take an interest in travelling, and some photography. All of my photos are available for viewing on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverjash" title="See my photos on Flickr">Flickr</a>.</p>
    <p>I really believe that computers can improve lives. I bare witness to it every day. But I believe we need to make technology more human. As a web developer, I want to be a part of that revolution.</p>
