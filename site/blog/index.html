        <h1>Theming with CSS Pre-processors</h1>

        <p>One thing that CSS Pre-processors really help with is maintaining large colour schemes. Sometimes, however, we need not just a large colour palette, but multiple colour schemes. If a colour is used sparingly across a design, CSS pre-processors can help a great deal with swapping out that lick of paint with a new one.</p>

<p>In a recent project I was confronted with a design that used a primary colour simply for text and borders. The design demonstrated that different sections of the website would have the same layout, but a different primary colour for its text and borders.</p>

        <h1>Responsive Typography and Systematic Breakpoints</h1>

        <p>No matter how hard I try, I will never consider myself to be a good designer. Rather, I consider myself to have a working knowledge of best UX practices, and as much as I love and appreciate the principles of UX design &mdash; especially responsive concerns such as content choreography &mdash; I'm just no good when it comes to piecing together a design. All that said, I wanted my blog to be a place where I would feel comfortable with my writing. The fundamental criterion of this design was to hold together various types of content in one place: personal writing, my work and my photography.</p>

<p>The reading experience of people who come here is incredibly important to me, as a typography lover myself. I don't trust myself to make those designs, and fortunately I was able to rest on the shoulders of giants &mdash; or should I say, maths &mdash; to achieve a reading experience I would consider optimal. Call me crazy.</p>

        <p>I have always been incredibly fascinated by nature, science, language, math&hellip; the list goes on. But, you only get one life, which is something I find a great shame.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy with the path I chose, but every so often I am reminded of how disconnected we all are from the other things this life has got offer. After all, though, we are only human. But we live in communities, each of us trying to support ourselves and our families. By this nature, we are self-centred creatures.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s me, doing my thing, whilst others die of starvation. But what can I do? Life is something you should grab by the throat. There&rsquo;s not enough time to fulfil every single inner ambition, and we have limits - time, physical ability, mental ability, to name but a few. Hell, my brain could never comprehend all of the chemistry and biology which I am fascinated by. Unfortunately, I just wasn&rsquo;t born that way. So, you have to grab life by the throat, and then live it to pieces. Make the best of what you&rsquo;ve got because it&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ll ever have, and you only have one life.</p>
