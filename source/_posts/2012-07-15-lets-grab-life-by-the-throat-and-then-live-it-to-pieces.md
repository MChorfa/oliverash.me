{% excerpt %}
I have always been incredibly fascinated by nature, science, language, math&hellip; the list goes on. But, you only get one life, which is something I find a great shame.

I’m happy with the path I chose, but every so often I am reminded of how disconnected we all are from the other things this life has got offer. After all, though, we are only human. But we live in communities, each of us trying to support ourselves and our families. By this nature, we are self-centred creatures.

Here’s me, doing my thing, whilst others die of starvation. But what can I do? Life is something you should grab by the throat. There’s not enough time to fulfil every single inner ambition, and we have limits - time, physical ability, mental ability, to name but a few. Hell, my brain could never comprehend all of the chemistry and biology which I am fascinated by. Unfortunately, I just wasn’t born that way. So, you have to grab life by the throat, and then live it to pieces. Make the best of what you’ve got because it’s all you’ll ever have, and you only have one life.

And to put things into perspective, those opportunities are bound to Earth. Our rocky, little planet. I think if you perceive yourself as a &ldquo;person&rdquo; in a community of people, your imagination is trapped.

We’re actually much less than that. I am just a spec of dust. Putting things into perspective like this has made me something of a life enthusiast. If we can grasp exactly what we are, then maybe each of us can discover the essence of our beings.
